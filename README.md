Based on Bilibili content creator "博van小哥哥's" video BV1HP411M7y4, he summarized all the New 3DS exclusive games (excluding some very niche Japanese regional titles). There are 94 New 3DS exclusive games in total, with gameplay demonstrations available on YouTube. Drawing on my years of gaming experience, I've reviewed these gameplay videos and assigned a star rating to each:  

☆: Garbage  
★: Poor in all aspects, not worth playing  
★★: Gameplay is quite poor  
★★★: High-quality niche game  
★★★★: High-quality game with a broad audience  
★★★★★: High-quality masterpiece

Summary: Only the following games are worth playing; the rest are considered garbage.  
Xenoblade Chronicles 3D  
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth  
Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition  
Fire Emblem Warriors  
Back in 1995 64  

Among these, The Binding of Isaac, Minecraft, and Back in 1995 are multi-platform games (playable on PC and other systems). Fire Emblem Warriors is a "Musou" (horde-slasher) game, which not everyone enjoys. This means Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is arguably the only truly indispensable title that can only be played on a New 3DS or New 2DS. If you don't care for Xenoblade Chronicles 3D, then an older 3DS (or 2DS) will suffice (assuming you're not considering the naked-eye 3D, as the older 3DS's brightness and visual experience aren't as comfortable as the 2DS).
